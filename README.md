# Armdroid-Automaton


A wireless controlled Robotic Arm, which helps doctors and healthcare workers to collect Corona samples and also to deliver food and medication to COVID patients.

## Abstract:
A wireless controlled Robotic Arm, which helps doctors and healthcare workers to collect Swab test samples and also to deliver food and medication to COVID patients.

Day by day, COVID-19 has been growing exponentially across the globe. Around the world, robots are being deployed to help the fight against COVID-19. The most direct use of robots has been in healthcare facilities. Frontline workers are working day and night to fight Corona. To mitigate the risk to the Health care workers, I have developed a wireless controlled robotic arm, “Armdroid Automaton”. The basic architecture of this robot includes a arm which has 4DOF (Degrees of Freedom), drive mechanism which helps to move in all directions. This Automaton can be effectively used in supplying food, medicines to Corona Patients without any contact. This contactless delivery the risk of attacking Corona to the workers can be minimized. Even this Automaton can be used to collect Swab test Sample (Corona Test samples) from patients, since the live interaction with the patient is much more dangerous.  This Automaton is wireless controlled and can be controlled using an android device. Using the drive mechanism, the automaton can travel to a safe distance to collect the sample (Move to a safe distance from the doctor). It can play a major role in delivering medicines to Corona affected persons from time to time. Automaton has 4 DOF which helps it to hold things.
